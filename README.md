# CustomDLModelClass
Introducing a custom deep learning model class, developed from scratch using only the fundamental concepts of deep learning, with a focus on linear regression. This class is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, and it incorporates key concepts such as Back Propagation, Gradient Descent, Sigmoid, Logloss function and more. The model class is designed to resemble a linear regression model, making it easy for users to understand the concepts and mechanics of deep learning models and linear regression.

This model class is designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to adjust and fine-tune the model to their specific needs. It includes a comprehensive understanding of activation functions, error functions, weighted sum, epochs and other important concepts that are crucial for building effective deep learning models, particularly linear regression models. The class is built using mathematical concepts, making it a more robust and effective approach than using pre-built libraries or frameworks.

The class is designed to be user-friendly, and is perfect for students, researchers, and data scientists who want to learn and understand the fundamental concepts of deep learning and linear regression. It's also great for those who want to build and train models that are tailored to their specific needs. The class includes a detailed explanation of back-propagation algorithm and gradient descent, which are the backbone of deep learning models. It also covers the mathematical concepts behind activation functions such as sigmoid and ReLU, which are essential for building models with non-linear relationships.

The class also covers the concepts of logloss function, which is used as a measure of model performance. It also covers the concept of weighted sum, which is used in the calculation of the output of a neuron in a deep learning model. Additionally, the class covers the concept of epochs, which is the number of times the model will iterate through the training data. The more epochs, the more the model will "learn" from the data, but it also increases the risk of overfitting.

One of the key features of this class is that it allows users to implement their own custom functions, such as custom activation functions, custom error functions, and custom weight initialization methods. This gives users the flexibility to tailor the model to their specific needs and requirements.

The class also includes an inbuilt feature of monitoring the training process, so users can easily track the progress of the model, and make any necessary adjustments. Additionally, the class includes a feature for saving and loading the trained model, allowing users to continue training at a later time or to use the trained model for prediction.

Overall, this custom deep learning model class is an excellent tool for learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of deep learning, particularly linear regression. It's perfect for students, researchers, and data scientists who want to build and train their own models. With its user-friendly design, detailed explanations, and customizable features, it's an ideal tool for anyone looking to delve deeper into the world of deep learning and linear regression.
